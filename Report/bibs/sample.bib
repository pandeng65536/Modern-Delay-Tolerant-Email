One such case, Internet naming, presents particular challenges when considering a multi-planet civilization. Proper operation of terrestrial DNS services and clients require constant, reasonably low latency connectivity to operate properly. These conditions are distinctly not present when considering interplanetary links; high latency and frequent disruption due to space weather events and general link availability prevail. To overcome these challenges in space networking, a delay and distruption tolerant (DTN) suite of protocols has been developed based on a store and forward mechanism, Bundle Protocol(BP). This DTN network, which optimizes to ensure bundle delivery, does not allow for end to end encapsulation of IP packets beyond terrestrial boundaries, as the latency still creates issues completing network transactions, even in the unlikely event of continuous link availability.},

The HOTP algorithm specifies an event-based OTP algorithm, where the moving factor is an event counter. The present work bases the moving factor on a time value. A time-based variant of the OTP algorithm provides short-lived OTP values, which are desirable for enhanced security. The proposed algorithm can be used across a wide range of network applications, from remote Virtual Private Network (VPN) access and Wi-Fi network logon to transaction-oriented Web applications. The authors believe that a common and shared algorithm will facilitate adoption of two-factor authentication on the Internet by enabling interoperability across commercial and open-source implementations.

Assertion of responsibility is validated through a cryptographic signature and by querying the Signer's domain directly to retrieve the appropriate public key. Message transit from author to recipient is through relays that typically make no substantive change to the message content and thus preserve the DKIM signature.
