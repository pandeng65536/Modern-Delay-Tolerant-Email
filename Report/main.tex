Reliable communication is a critical challenge in deep-space networks, which are characterized by high latency and frequent disruptions. Adapting fundamental tools like email for these Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) environments is therefore essential.

This dissertation evaluates a modern DTN-based email proposal (draft-johnson-dtn-interplanetary-smtp) to assess its feasibility and limitations in a simulated deep-space context. To facilitate this analysis, a Docker-based interplanetary network simulation platform was developed. The platform integrates Postfix, Thunderbird, ION-DTN, and the BPMail gateway to form a complete email stack capable of simulating realistic network delays.

Experimental results show that the proposal performs well when the user and mail server are in the same network region. However, testing a user mobility scenario—where the user accesses their home mail server from a remote network—revealed a architectural flaw. The system's real-time protocols (IMAP/SMTP) bypass the DTN gateway, attempting a direct connection that fails as latency increases, rendering the system inoperable.

To address this, a conceptual extension is proposed. This extension introduces a local agent to decouple direct user interactions from background server synchronization, offering a path forward to resolve the issues.
